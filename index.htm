        <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to the world that we have built for ourself.</h2>
        <p style="color: blue;">This is the start of a beautiful journey through a world of code that I am committed too.  My goal is to double down and really dive into the world of code and design.  My mission is to get skilled at front end development with Javascript and its libraries and then move onto C\C++.  This is my mission and I must succeed. </p>
